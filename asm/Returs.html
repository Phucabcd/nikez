        <h1>WHAT IS NIKE'S RETURNS POLICY?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>All Nike.com and Nike App purchases can be returned within 30 days (some exceptions apply). To be eligible, an item must be unworn, unwashed with the complete accessories included, and in the original packaging, which must also be in a resaleable condition. This policy includes custom Nike By You sneakers.

            After 30 days, you can still return items with Nike's approval if the items meet the return criteria stated above or otherwise. We reserve the right not to agree to the return.
            
            And remember, returns are always free for Nike Membersâ€”just make sure you sign in during checkout.
            
            So go ahead, shop with confidence.</p>
